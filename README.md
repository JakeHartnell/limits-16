> LIMITS aims to foster research on the impact of present or future ecological, material, energetic, and/or societal limits on computing and computing research to respond to such limits. The medium-term aim of the workshop is to foster concrete research, potentially of an interdisciplinary nature, that innovates on technologies, techniques, and contexts for computing within fundamental limits. A longer-term goal is to build a community around relevant topics and research. A goal of this community is to impact society through the design and development of computing systems in the abundant present for use in a future of limits and/or scarcity.
>
> We envision two broad categories of papers: "discussion papers" and "systems papers" (see below). Submissions do not need to strictly fit into either category. All papers should succinctly frame the limits that are of interest to the author(s).
>
> Discussion papers explore the nature of limits and computing. Good discussion contributions will detail the nature of the limits of interest, describe their impact on computing, and present directions for future research. Relevant topics include, but are not limited to:
>
> Sustainability and computing
> Re-evaluation of conventional computing premises (e.g. Moore's law)
> Discussion of new limits and their implications for computing
> Analysis of unnecessary computing
> Analysis of greenwashing in computing
> Ecological economics and/or biophysical economics and computing
> Implications of limits for computing systems for health, education, agriculture, transportation, entertainment, commerce, etc.
>
> Systems papers describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of computing systems that work within or help cope with limits. Also of interest are evaluations of systems that fail due to limits. Good systems contributions will address problems that meet present or future societal needs, describe clear limits and operational boundaries, and provide a detailed evaluation of the system in question. Relevant topics include, but are not limited to:
>
> Material- and manufacturing-constrained computing devices
> Energy- and material-efficient computing and communication
> Wide-area communication under constraints
> Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Interaction Design under constraints
> Evaluation of limits to modern computing systems
> Life-cycle analysis of computing systems under limits
> Computer architecture for constrained computing
> Systems for health, education, agriculture, transportation, entertainment, commerce, etc. under limits
